    <text>Reload: The weapon can be fired a number of times equal to its Reload number before the wielder must spend an Attack or an Action to reload. You must have one free hand to reload a firearm.</text>
    <text />
    <text>Misfire: Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice roll is equal or lower than the weapon's misfire score, the weapon misfires. The attack misses, and the weapon cannot be used again until you spend an action to try and repair it. To repair your firearm, you must make a successful Tinker's Tools check (DC equal to 8 + Misfire score).</text>
    <text />
    <text>Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.</text>
    <text />
    <text>If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon.</text>
    <text />
    <text>Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</text>

				<text>This class and all Orders, including Order of the Lycan, designed by Matthew Mercer and are available on dmsguild.com</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Hunter's Bane</name>
				<text>Beginning at 1st level, you have survived the Hunter's Bane, a dangerous, long-guarded ritual that alters your life's blood, forever binding you to the darkness and honing your senses against it. You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track fey, fiends, or undead, as well as on Intelligence ability checks to recall information about them.</text>
				<text />
				<text>The Hunter's Bane also empowers your body to control and shape hemocraft magic, using your own blood and life essence to fuel your abilities. Some of your features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</text>
				<text />
				<text>Hemocraft save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier..</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Blood Maledict</name>
				<text>At 1st level, you gain the ability to channel, and sometimes sacrifice, a part of your vital essence to curse and manipulate creatures through hemocraft magic. You gain one blood curse of your choice, detailed in the “Blood Curses” section at the end of the class description. You learn one additional blood curse of your choice, and you can choose one of the blood curses you know and replace it with another blood curse, at 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level.</text>
				<text>When you use your Blood Maledict, you choose which curse to invoke. While invoking a blood curse, but before it affects the target, you can choose to amplify the curse by losing a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table. An amplified curse gains an additional effect, noted in the curse's description. Creatures that do not have blood in their bodies are immune to blood curses, unless you have amplified the curse.</text>
				<text>You can use this feature once. Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Blood Maledict feature twice, at 13th level you can use it three times between rests, and at 17th level, you can use it four times between rests. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</text>

				<name>Fighting Style</name>
				<text>At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature option="YES">
				<name>Fighting Style: Archery</name>
				<text>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature option="YES">
				<name>Fighting Style: Dueling</name>
				<text>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature option="YES">
				<name>Fighting Style: Great Weapon Fighting</name>
				<text>When you roll a 1 or 2 on a non-rite damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature option="YES">
				<name>Fighting Style: Two-Weapon Fighting</name>
				<text>When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Crimson Rite</name>
				<text>At 2nd level, you learn to invoke a rite of hemocraft within your weapon at the cost of your own vitality. Choose one rite from the Primal Rites list below to learn.</text>
				<text>As a bonus action, you can activate a crimson rite on a single weapon with the elemental energy of a known rite of your choice that lasts until you finish a short or long rest, or if you aren't holding the weapon at the end of your turn. When you activate a rite, you lose a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table.</text>
				<text>For the duration, attacks from this weapon deal an additional 1d4 damage of the chosen rite's type. This damage is magical, and increases as you gain levels as a blood hunter, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table. A weapon can only hold a single active rite at a time.</text>
				<text>You learn an additional Primal Rite at 7th level, and access to an Esoteric Rite at 14th level.</text>

			<feature>
				<name>Blood Hunter Order</name>
				<text>At 3rd level, you commit to an order of blood hunter martial focus. Choose Order of the Ghostslayer, Order of the Profane Soul, Order of the Mutant, or Order of the Lycan, all detailed at the end of the class description. The order you choose grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 11th, 15th, and 18th level.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Order of the Ghostslayer</name>
				<text>The Order of the Ghostslayer is the oldest of the orders, having originally rediscovered the secrets of blood magic and refined them for combat against the scourge of undeath. Ghostslayers seek out and study the moment of death, obsessing over the mysteries of the transition and how it can become corrupted by unholy powers to rise once more. Tuning their abilities to annihilate such abominations, these zealous blood hunters seek out the sources of such necromantic energies, intent to destroy them wherever they arise.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Order of the Ghostslayer: Rite of the Dawn</name>
				<text>When you join this order at 3rd level, you learn the Rite of the Dawn esoteric rite (detailed below).</text>
				<text />
				<text>Rite of the Dawn. Your rite damage is radiant damage. While the rite is active, you gain the following benefits:</text>
				<text />
				<text>Your weapon sheds bright light out to a radius of 20 feet.</text>
				<text>You have resistance to necrotic damage.</text>
				<text>Your weapon deals one additional hemocraft die of rite damage when you hit an undead.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Order of the Ghostslayer: Curse Specialist</name>
				<text>Beginning at 3rd level, your ancient order teaches advanced mastery over blood curses. You gain an additional use of your Blood Maledict feature. In addition, your blood curses can target any creature, whether it has blood or not.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Order of the Profane Soul</name>
				<text>Those who have taken to the Order of the Profane Soul have seen the limits of hemocraft against some of the most ancient and cruel fiends and terrors of the world. Unable to pursue beings of such power, creatures able to vanish amongst the nobles without a trace, or bend the mind of the most stalwart warrior with but a glance, this order trusted in their resilience and delved into this same well of corrupting arcane knowledge, making pacts with lesser evils to better combat the greater. While they may have traded a part of themselves, members of this order believe the power gained far outweighs the price, for even devils now quake when they know they've drawn the attention of the Order of the Profane Soul.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Order of the Profane Soul: Otherworldly Patron</name>
				<text>When you reach 3rd level, you strike a bargain with an otherworldly being of your choice: the Archfey, the Fiend, or the Great Old One, each detailed in the Player's Handbook, the Undying within the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, and the Celestial or Hexblade in Xanathar's Guide to Everything. Your choice augments some of your order features.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Otherworldly Patron: The Archfey</name>
				<text>You have chosen the Archfey as your otherworldly patron.</text>
			</feature>

				<text>You have chosen the Undying as your otherworldly patron.</text>
			</feature>
			
			<feature>
				<name>Order of the Profane Soul: Pact Magic</name>
				<text>When you reach 3rd level, you can augment your combat techniques with the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 of the PHB for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 of the Player's Handbook for the Warlock spell list.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Cantrips. You learn two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn an additional warlock cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</text>
				<text>Spell Slots. The Profane Soul Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</text>
				<text>For example, when you are 8th level, you have two 2nd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell witch bolt, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 2nd-level spell.</text>
				<text>Spell Known of 1st Level and Higher. At 3rd level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.</text>
				<text>The Spells Known column of the Profane Soul table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 11th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.</text>
				<text>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class and order, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
				<text>Spellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
				<text>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</text>
				<text>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Order of the Profane Soul: Rite Focus</name>
				<text>Beginning at 3rd level, your weapon becomes a core to your pact with your chosen dark patron.

				<name>Order of the Mutant</name>
				<text>The process of the Hunter's Bane is a painful, scarring, and sometimes fatal experience. Those that survive find themselves irrevocably changed, enhanced. Some found this experience exalting, embracing the ability to alter one's own physiology through a combination of hemocraft and corrupted alchemy. Over generations of experimentation, a splinter order of blood hunters began to emerge, one that focused on brewing toxic elixirs to modify their capabilities in battle, altering their blood and, over time, become something beyond what they once were. They called themselves the Order of the Mutant. Researching their targets to know their strengths and weaknesses, these blood hunters can alter their biology to be best prepared for the coming conflict.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Order of the Mutant: Formulae</name>
				<text>You begin to uncover forbidden alchemical formulae that temporarily alter your mental and physical abilities.</text>

				<text>Additionally, when you gain a new mutagen formula, you can choose one of the formulae you already know and replace it with a new mutagen formula.</text>
			</feature>

				<text>As a bonus action you can consume a single mutagen, and the effects and side effects last until you finish a short or long rest, unless otherwise specified. While one or more mutagens are affecting you, you can use an action to focus and flush the toxins from your system, ending the effects and side effects of all mutagens.</text>
				<text>Mutagens are designed for your biology and have no effect on other creatures. They are also unstable by nature, losing their potency over time and becoming inert if not used before you finish your next short or long rest.</text>
			</feature>

				<name>Order of the Lycan</name>
				<text>Of the many terrible curses that plague the realm, few are as ancient or as feared as Lycanthropy. Passed through blood, this affliction seeds a host with the savage strength and hunger for violence of a wicked beast. The Order of the Lycan is a proud order of blood hunters who undergo “The Taming,” a ceremonial inflicting of lycanthropy from a senior member. These hunters then use their abilities to harness the power of the monster they harbor without losing themselves to it. Through intense honing of one's own willpower, combined with the secrets of the order's blood magic rituals, members learn to control and unleash their hybrid form for short periods of time. Enhanced physical prowess, unnatural resilience, and razor sharp claws make these warriors a terrible foe to any evil that crosses their path. Yet, no training is perfect, and without care and complete focus, even the greatest of blood hunters can temporarily lose themselves to the bloodlust.</text>
				<text>The Onus of Lycanthropy. Those inducted into the Order of the Lycan choose this path with conviction, understanding the terrible burden it is and the challenges it brings. Where most who embrace this curse grow wicked, mad, even murderous, these blood hunters accept the gifts of the beast while maintaining control through intense training and blood magic. These factors enable a member of the Order of the Lycan to prevent the spread of their curse through blood, should they wish to. One of the most sacred oaths of this order is to never infect another without the order's sanction.</text>
				<text>Should a member of the Order of the Lycan be cured of the lycanthropic curse, it is a terrible shame on their name, the order, and those who carry the curse still. There have been passages written about members being cleansed against their will, but those brothers and sisters readily return to the order to undergo a renewed initiation of The Taming, reintroducing the curse to their bodies and restoring their honor.</text>
				<text>Lycanthropy comes in many forms. Each version of the curse is bound to a specific beast: wolf, bear, tiger, boar, and rat are a few of the more well-known variations. The strain of the curse defines the beast a hybrid form will share, but the features the curse bestows remain relatively uniform across strains.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Order of the Lycan: Heightened Senses</name>
				<text>Starting when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you begin to adopt the improved abilities of a natural predator. You gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Order of the Lycan: Hybrid Transformation</name>
				<text>Upon choosing this archetype at 3rd level, you begin to learn to control the lycanthropic curse that now lives in your blood. As a bonus action, you can transform into your hybrid form for up to 1 hour. You can speak, use equipment, and wear armor in this form. You can revert to your normal form earlier as a bonus action. You automatically revert to your normal form if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. This feature replaces the rules for Lycanthropy within the Monster's Manual.</text>
				<text>Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. While you are transformed, you gain the following features:</text>
				<text />
				<text>Feral Might. You gain a +1 to melee damage rolls. This bonus increases by 1 at 11th and 18th level. You also have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</text>
				<text>Resilient Hide. You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks not made with silver weapons. While you are not wearing heavy armor, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC.</text>
				<text>Predatory Strikes. You can apply your Crimson Rite feature to your unarmed strikes as a single weapon. You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes. When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 slashing damage. The damage increases to 1d8 at 11th level.</text>
				<text>Bloodlust. If you begin your turn with no more than half of your maximum hit points, you must succeed on a DC 8 Wisdom saving throw or move directly towards the nearest creature to you and use the Attack action against that creature. You can choose whether or not to use your Extra Attack feature for this frenzied attack. If there is more than one possible target, roll to randomly determine the target. You then regain control for the remainder of your turn.</text>
				<text>If you are under an effect that prevents you from concentrating (like the barbarian's Rage feature), you automatically fail this saving throw.</text>

        <name>Gunslinger: Grit</name>
        <text>At the end of each Short Rest, a Gunslinger gains a number of Grit points equal to their Wisdom Modifier (minimum 1). The number of Grit points the Gunslinger has can never exceed their Wisdom modifier. The Gunslinger can regain Grit points in the following ways:</text>
        <text>Critical Hit with a Firearm:</text>
        <text>Each time the Gunslinger scores a Critical Hit with a Firearm attack while in the heat of combat, they regain 1 Grit point.</text>
        <text>Killing Blow with a Firearm:</text>
        <text>When the Gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a Firearm attack, they regain 1 Grit point. If the death was due to a Critical Hit, you only get the 1 Grit, not two.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Gunslinger: Deeds</name>
        <text>Gunslingers use Grit points to perform Deeds. Some deeds are instant bonuses or attacks, while others are bonuses that can last for a period of time. Some deeds last as long as the Gunslinger has 1 Grit Point. A Gunslinger can only use Deeds that they meet the required level for, and cannot combine multiple Deeds into a single attack.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Gunsmith. Starting at 3rd level, the Gunslinger gains proficiency with Tinker's Tools, able to use them to craft ammunition, repair damaged firearms, or even draft and create them.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Deadeye. Starting at 3rd level, the Gunslinger can spend 1 Grit point to gain Advantage on the next Attack roll they make this round. The Gunslinger chooses to make a Deadeye attack and spends Grit before making the attack roll.</text>

        <text />
        <text>Misfire. Whenever the Firearm is fired in a way that requires an Attack Roll, if the dice roll is equal to or lower than the Misfire number, the weapon Misfires, the attack misses, and it cannot be used to attack again until an Action and successful Tinker's Tools Ability Check (DC = 10 + Firearm's Misfire Score) is used to repair and clear the weapon. Should the Tinker's Tools check fail, the weapon is considered broken and must be repaired out of combat at half the cost of the weapon (or DM's discretion).</text>

        <text>Violent Shot. Starting at 7th Level, the Gunslinger can spend 1 or more Grit points before rolling an Attack. For each Grit point spent, that Attack gains +1 to the weapon's Misfire number. If the attack hits, it deals an additional dice of Firearm damage per Grit point spent. If the attack misses, Grit points are still expended. (ex: 3 Grit points = +3 to misfire, +3d[Firearm Damage Die]). Weapons with multiple damage dice add only 1 die per Grit spent.

To repair your firearm, you must make a successful Tinker's Tools check (DC equal to 8 + Misfire score).</text>
    <text />
    <text>Scatter: An attack is made on each creature within a 30ft cone. These attacks are simultaneous. If an affected creature is adjacent to you, they suffer double damage on a hit. This attack cannot be affected by any shot features.</text>
    <text />
    <text>Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.</text>
    <text />
    <text>If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon.</text>
    <text />
    <text>Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</text>

      <feature>
        <name>Canny Defense</name>
        <text>Some seekers choose to dodge incoming attacks deliberately, using forethought and prediction rather than agility. As long as you're not wearing heavy armor, you may add your Intelligence modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier to your AC. If you wear medium armor, the maximum bonus is restricted as normal.</text>
        <text>If you have a negative Dexterity modifier, it is applied as a penalty to your AC even if you add your Intelligence modifier this way.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature>
        <name>Eclectic</name>
        <text>Either from learning or from experience, you have gained extensive insight about the world around you. You choose between gaining proficiency with two tools, learning two languages of your choice, or one of each. You can't learn exotic languages through this feature.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature>
        <name>Keen Observation</name>
        <text>You have learned the value of paying close attention to detail. You can use the Search action as a bonus action.</text>

        <name>Spellcasting</name>
        <text>By the time you reach 2nd level, your cunning has granted you the ability to reshape reality, allowing you to cast spells. Your spells are discoveries that you can innately exploit.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Spell Slots</text>
        <text>The seeker table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</text>
        <text>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the seeker spell list. You learn an additional seeker spell of your choice at each odd numbered level thereafter. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</text>
        <text>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the seeker spells you know and replace it with another spell from the seeker spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
        <text />
        <text>Spellcasting Ability</text>
        <text>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your seeker Spells, since your cunning allows you to fully control the arcane energies. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a seeker spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
        <text>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your intelligence modifier</text>
        <text>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</text>

      <feature>
        <name>Improvisation</name>
        <text>Starting at 2nd level, you can adapt your tactics, feinting to predict your foes patterns and get the upper hand. Once during your turn, when you miss with a weapon attack, you can make another weapon attack as part of the same action.</text>

          <text>Starting at 10th level, you can read the magical aura of an item to know more about its origins. By spending 1 minute performing an arcane investigation with an object, you may pry out certain information imprinted on it. The object must be within your reach while performing this ritual. The information you draw out from an object can only be about its creation or about events that transpired in its vicinity in the past 24 hours.</text>
          <text>The information stored on objects about events can only relate to happenings that could be seen or heard within 20 feet of the object.</text>
          <text>At GM's discretion, the object may also store information from other significant events around it. For example, a sword may store information about why it was broken, or about important creatures that were slain by it.</text>

        <name>Secret Broker Pursuit: Mint Memory</name>
        <text>Starting at 10th level, you have access to a special ritual that allows you to store a creature's memory into an object or show a stored memory to others. After spending 1 minute while a coin is within your reach, a willing creature may touch the object to store one of its memories into it, at the creature's choice. Even if the creature is uncertain about the full details of that memory, storing the memory this way imparts all the details as far as that creature was aware of at the time. An object can only store one memory at the time, and the memory cannot span a period of time longer than 1 hour. After a creature stores a memory this way, if the creature is willing, that creature may also erase that specific memory from its mind.</text>
        <text>After this is done, you may select a command word. When a creature touches the object and speaks that word, that creature witnesses the memory as it was stored. This an immediate effect that takes no time.</text>
