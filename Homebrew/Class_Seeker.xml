      </feature>
      <feature>
        <name>Canny Defense</name>
        <text>Some seekers choose to dodge incoming attacks deliberately, using forethought and prediction rather than agility. As long as you're not wearing heavy armor, you may add your Intelligence modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier to your AC. If you wear medium armor, the maximum bonus is restricted as normal.</text>
        <text>If you have a negative Dexterity modifier, it is applied as a penalty to your AC even if you add your Intelligence modifier this way.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature>
        <name>Eclectic</name>
        <text>Either from learning or from experience, you have gained extensive insight about the world around you. You choose between gaining proficiency with two tools, learning two languages of your choice, or one of each. You can't learn exotic languages through this feature.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature>
        <name>Keen Observation</name>
        <text>You have learned the value of paying close attention to detail. You can use the Search action as a bonus action.</text>
        <text>Additionally, you add your Intelligence modifier as a bonus to Wisdom (Insight) and Wisdom (Perception) checks.</text>

      <feature>
        <name>Spellcasting</name>
        <text>By the time you reach 2nd level, your cunning has granted you the ability to reshape reality, allowing you to cast spells. Your spells are discoveries that you can innately exploit.</text>
        <text/>
        <text>Spell Slots</text>
        <text>The seeker table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
        <text/>
        <text>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</text>
        <text>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the seeker spell list. You learn an additional seeker spell of your choice at each odd numbered level thereafter. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</text>
        <text>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the seeker spells you know and replace it with another spell from the seeker spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
        <text/>
        <text>Spellcasting Ability</text>
        <text>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your seeker Spells, since your cunning allows you to fully control the arcane energies. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a seeker spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
        <text>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your intelligence modifier</text>
        <text>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</text>

      </feature>
      <feature>
        <name>Improvisation</name>
        <text>Starting at 2nd level, you can adapt your tactics, feinting to predict your foes patterns and get the upper hand. Once during your turn, when you miss with a weapon attack, you can make another weapon attack as part of the same action.</text>
        <text>You may use this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum one). You regain all uses of this ability once you finish a short or long rest.</text>

          <name>Relic Hunter Pursuit: Object Reading</name>
          <text>Starting at 10th level, you can read the magical aura of an item to know more about its origins. By spending 1 minute performing an arcane investigation with an object, you may pry out certain information imprinted on it. The object must be within your reach while performing this ritual. The information you draw out from an object can only be about its creation or about events that transpired in its vicinity in the past 24 hours.</text>
          <text>The information stored on objects about events can only relate to happenings that could be seen or heard within 20 feet of the object.</text>
          <text>At GM's discretion, the object may also store information from other significant events around it. For example, a sword may store information about why it was broken, or about important creatures that were slain by it.</text>

        <name>Secret Broker Pursuit: Mint Memory</name>
        <text>Starting at 10th level, you have access to a special ritual that allows you to store a creature's memory into an object or show a stored memory to others. After spending 1 minute while a coin is within your reach, a willing creature may touch the object to store one of its memories into it, at the creature's choice. Even if the creature is uncertain about the full details of that memory, storing the memory this way imparts all the details as far as that creature was aware of at the time. An object can only store one memory at the time, and the memory cannot span a period of time longer than 1 hour. After a creature stores a memory this way, if the creature is willing, that creature may also erase that specific memory from its mind.</text>
        <text>After this is done, you may select a command word. When a creature touches the object and speaks that word, that creature witnesses the memory as it was stored. This an immediate effect that takes no time.</text>
