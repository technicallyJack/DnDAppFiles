				<name>Credits!</name>
				<text>This class and all Orders, including Order of the Lycan, designed by Matthew Mercer and are available on dmsguild.com</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Hunter's Bane</name>
				<text>Beginning at 1st level, you have survived the Hunter's Bane, a dangerous, long-guarded ritual that alters your life's blood, forever binding you to the darkness and honing your senses against it. You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track fey, fiends, or undead, as well as on Intelligence ability checks to recall information about them.</text>
				<text />
				<text>The Hunter's Bane also empowers your body to control and shape hemocraft magic, using your own blood and life essence to fuel your abilities. Some of your features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</text>
				<text />
				<text>Hemocraft save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier..</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Blood Maledict</name>
				<text>At 1st level, you gain the ability to channel, and sometimes sacrifice, a part of your vital essence to curse and manipulate creatures through hemocraft magic. You gain one blood curse of your choice, detailed in the “Blood Curses” section at the end of the class description. You learn one additional blood curse of your choice, and you can choose one of the blood curses you know and replace it with another blood curse, at 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level.</text>
				<text>When you use your Blood Maledict, you choose which curse to invoke. While invoking a blood curse, but before it affects the target, you can choose to amplify the curse by losing a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table. An amplified curse gains an additional effect, noted in the curse's description. Creatures that do not have blood in their bodies are immune to blood curses, unless you have amplified the curse.</text>
				<text>You can use this feature once. Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Blood Maledict feature twice, at 13th level you can use it three times between rests, and at 17th level, you can use it four times between rests. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</text>
			</feature>
		</autolevel>
		<autolevel level="2">
			<feature>
				<name>Fighting Style</name>
				<text>At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature option="YES">
				<name>Fighting Style: Archery</name>
				<text>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature option="YES">
				<name>Fighting Style: Dueling</name>
				<text>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature option="YES">
				<name>Fighting Style: Great Weapon Fighting</name>
				<text>When you roll a 1 or 2 on a non-rite damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature option="YES">
				<name>Fighting Style: Two-Weapon Fighting</name>
				<text>When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Crimson Rite</name>
				<text>At 2nd level, you learn to invoke a rite of hemocraft within your weapon at the cost of your own vitality. Choose one rite from the Primal Rites list below to learn.</text>
				<text>As a bonus action, you can activate a crimson rite on a single weapon with the elemental energy of a known rite of your choice that lasts until you finish a short or long rest, or if you aren't holding the weapon at the end of your turn. When you activate a rite, you lose a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table.</text>
				<text>For the duration, attacks from this weapon deal an additional 1d4 damage of the chosen rite's type. This damage is magical, and increases as you gain levels as a blood hunter, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table. A weapon can only hold a single active rite at a time.</text>
				<text>You learn an additional Primal Rite at 7th level, and access to an Esoteric Rite at 14th level.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Primal Rites: Rite of the Flame.</name>
				<text>Your rite damage is fire type.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Primal Rites: Rite of the Frozen.</name>
				<text>Your rite damage is cold type.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">

				<text>Your rite damage is lightning type.</text>

		<autolevel level="3">
			<feature>
				<name>Blood Hunter Order</name>
				<text>At 3rd level, you commit to an order of blood hunter martial focus. Choose Order of the Ghostslayer, Order of the Profane Soul, Order of the Mutant, or Order of the Lycan, all detailed at the end of the class description. The order you choose grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 11th, 15th, and 18th level.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Order of the Ghostslayer</name>
				<text>The Order of the Ghostslayer is the oldest of the orders, having originally rediscovered the secrets of blood magic and refined them for combat against the scourge of undeath. Ghostslayers seek out and study the moment of death, obsessing over the mysteries of the transition and how it can become corrupted by unholy powers to rise once more. Tuning their abilities to annihilate such abominations, these zealous blood hunters seek out the sources of such necromantic energies, intent to destroy them wherever they arise.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Order of the Ghostslayer: Rite of the Dawn</name>
				<text>When you join this order at 3rd level, you learn the Rite of the Dawn esoteric rite (detailed below).</text>
				<text/>
				<text>Rite of the Dawn. Your rite damage is radiant damage. While the rite is active, you gain the following benefits:</text>
				<text/>
				<text>Your weapon sheds bright light out to a radius of 20 feet.</text>
				<text>You have resistance to necrotic damage.</text>
				<text>Your weapon deals one additional hemocraft die of rite damage when you hit an undead.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Order of the Ghostslayer: Curse Specialist</name>
				<text>Beginning at 3rd level, your ancient order teaches advanced mastery over blood curses. You gain an additional use of your Blood Maledict feature. In addition, your blood curses can target any creature, whether it has blood or not.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Order of the Profane Soul</name>
				<text>Those who have taken to the Order of the Profane Soul have seen the limits of hemocraft against some of the most ancient and cruel fiends and terrors of the world. Unable to pursue beings of such power, creatures able to vanish amongst the nobles without a trace, or bend the mind of the most stalwart warrior with but a glance, this order trusted in their resilience and delved into this same well of corrupting arcane knowledge, making pacts with lesser evils to better combat the greater. While they may have traded a part of themselves, members of this order believe the power gained far outweighs the price, for even devils now quake when they know they've drawn the attention of the Order of the Profane Soul.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Order of the Profane Soul: Otherworldly Patron</name>
				<text>When you reach 3rd level, you strike a bargain with an otherworldly being of your choice: the Archfey, the Fiend, or the Great Old One, each detailed in the Player's Handbook, the Undying within the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, and the Celestial or Hexblade in Xanathar's Guide to Everything. Your choice augments some of your order features.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Otherworldly Patron: The Archfey</name>
				<text>You have chosen the Archfey as your otherworldly patron.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Otherworldly Patron: The Celestial</name>
				<text>You have chosen the Celestial as your otherworldly patron.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Otherworldly Patron: The Fiend</name>
				<text>You have chosen the Fiend as your otherworldly patron.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Otherworldly Patron: The Great Old One</name>
				<text>You have chosen the Great Old One as your otherworldly patron.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Otherworldly Patron: The Hexblade</name>
				<text>You have chosen the Hexblade as your otherworldly patron.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Otherworldly Patron: The Undying</name>
				<text>You have chosen the Undying as your otherworldly patron.</text>
			</feature>
			<!-- This archetype is a mess in here. Not sure how to do this better yet. -->
			<feature>
				<name>Order of the Profane Soul: Pact Magic</name>
				<text>When you reach 3rd level, you can augment your combat techniques with the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 of the PHB for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 of the Player's Handbook for the Warlock spell list.</text>
				<text/>
				<text>Cantrips. You learn two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn an additional warlock cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</text>
				<text>Spell Slots. The Profane Soul Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</text>
				<text>For example, when you are 8th level, you have two 2nd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell witch bolt, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 2nd-level spell.</text>
				<text>Spell Known of 1st Level and Higher. At 3rd level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.</text>
				<text>The Spells Known column of the Profane Soul table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 11th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.</text>
				<text>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class and order, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
				<text>Spellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
				<text>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</text>
				<text>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Order of the Profane Soul: Rite Focus</name>
				<text>Beginning at 3rd level, your weapon becomes a core to your pact with your chosen dark patron. While you have an active Crimson Rite, you can use your weapon as a spellcasting focus (found in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook) for your warlock spells, and you gain a specific benefit based on your chosen pact (outlined below).</text>
				<text/>
				<text>The Archfey. When you deal rite damage to a creature, it glows with faint light until the end of your next turn. For the duration, the creature can't benefit from half cover, three-quarters cover, or being invisible.</text>
				<text>The Celestial. You can expend a use of your Blood Maledict feature as a bonus action to heal one creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. They regain a number of hit points hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).</text>
				<text>The Fiend. While using the Rite of the Flame, if you roll a 1 or 2 on your rite damage die, you can reroll the die and choose which roll to use.</text>
				<text>The Great Old One. When you score a critical hit against a creature while using the weapon, that creature is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.</text>
				<text>Whenever you target a creature with a blood curse, your next attack against the cursed creature deals additional damage equal to your proficiency modifier.</text>
				<text>The Undying. Whenever you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points using a weapon attack, you regain a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Order of the Mutant</name>
				<text>The process of the Hunter's Bane is a painful, scarring, and sometimes fatal experience. Those that survive find themselves irrevocably changed, enhanced. Some found this experience exalting, embracing the ability to alter one's own physiology through a combination of hemocraft and corrupted alchemy. Over generations of experimentation, a splinter order of blood hunters began to emerge, one that focused on brewing toxic elixirs to modify their capabilities in battle, altering their blood and, over time, become something beyond what they once were. They called themselves the Order of the Mutant. Researching their targets to know their strengths and weaknesses, these blood hunters can alter their biology to be best prepared for the coming conflict.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Order of the Mutant: Formulae</name>
				<text>You begin to uncover forbidden alchemical formulae that temporarily alter your mental and physical abilities.</text>
				<text>Beginning at 3rd level, you choose to learn four mutagen formulae. Your formula options are detailed at the end of this order description. You gain an additional formula at 7th level, 11th level, 15th level, and 18th level.</text>
				<text>Additionally, when you gain a new mutagen formula, you can choose one of the formulae you already know and replace it with a new mutagen formula.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Order of the Mutant: Mutagencraft</name>
				<text>At 3rd level, you can concoct a single mutagen when you finish a short or long rest. Starting at 7th level, the number of mutagens you can create when you finish a rest increases to two, and at 15th level, you can now create three mutagens.</text>
				<text>As a bonus action you can consume a single mutagen, and the effects and side effects last until you finish a short or long rest, unless otherwise specified. While one or more mutagens are affecting you, you can use an action to focus and flush the toxins from your system, ending the effects and side effects of all mutagens.</text>
				<text>Mutagens are designed for your biology and have no effect on other creatures. They are also unstable by nature, losing their potency over time and becoming inert if not used before you finish your next short or long rest.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Order of the Mutant: Mutagen List</name>
				<text>These mutagens are presented in alphabetical order. You can learn a mutagen at the same time you meet its prerequisites.</text>

			<feature>
				<name>Order of the Lycan</name>
				<text>Of the many terrible curses that plague the realm, few are as ancient or as feared as Lycanthropy. Passed through blood, this affliction seeds a host with the savage strength and hunger for violence of a wicked beast. The Order of the Lycan is a proud order of blood hunters who undergo “The Taming,” a ceremonial inflicting of lycanthropy from a senior member. These hunters then use their abilities to harness the power of the monster they harbor without losing themselves to it. Through intense honing of one's own willpower, combined with the secrets of the order's blood magic rituals, members learn to control and unleash their hybrid form for short periods of time. Enhanced physical prowess, unnatural resilience, and razor sharp claws make these warriors a terrible foe to any evil that crosses their path. Yet, no training is perfect, and without care and complete focus, even the greatest of blood hunters can temporarily lose themselves to the bloodlust.</text>
				<text>The Onus of Lycanthropy. Those inducted into the Order of the Lycan choose this path with conviction, understanding the terrible burden it is and the challenges it brings. Where most who embrace this curse grow wicked, mad, even murderous, these blood hunters accept the gifts of the beast while maintaining control through intense training and blood magic. These factors enable a member of the Order of the Lycan to prevent the spread of their curse through blood, should they wish to. One of the most sacred oaths of this order is to never infect another without the order's sanction.</text>
				<text>Should a member of the Order of the Lycan be cured of the lycanthropic curse, it is a terrible shame on their name, the order, and those who carry the curse still. There have been passages written about members being cleansed against their will, but those brothers and sisters readily return to the order to undergo a renewed initiation of The Taming, reintroducing the curse to their bodies and restoring their honor.</text>
				<text>Lycanthropy comes in many forms. Each version of the curse is bound to a specific beast: wolf, bear, tiger, boar, and rat are a few of the more well-known variations. The strain of the curse defines the beast a hybrid form will share, but the features the curse bestows remain relatively uniform across strains.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Order of the Lycan: Heightened Senses</name>
				<text>Starting when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you begin to adopt the improved abilities of a natural predator. You gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Order of the Lycan: Hybrid Transformation</name>
				<text>Upon choosing this archetype at 3rd level, you begin to learn to control the lycanthropic curse that now lives in your blood. As a bonus action, you can transform into your hybrid form for up to 1 hour. You can speak, use equipment, and wear armor in this form. You can revert to your normal form earlier as a bonus action. You automatically revert to your normal form if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. This feature replaces the rules for Lycanthropy within the Monster's Manual.</text>
				<text>Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. While you are transformed, you gain the following features:</text>
				<text/>
				<text>Feral Might. You gain a +1 to melee damage rolls. This bonus increases by 1 at 11th and 18th level. You also have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</text>
				<text>Resilient Hide. You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks not made with silver weapons. While you are not wearing heavy armor, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC.</text>
				<text>Predatory Strikes. You can apply your Crimson Rite feature to your unarmed strikes as a single weapon. You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes. When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 slashing damage. The damage increases to 1d8 at 11th level.</text>
				<text>Bloodlust. If you begin your turn with no more than half of your maximum hit points, you must succeed on a DC 8 Wisdom saving throw or move directly towards the nearest creature to you and use the Attack action against that creature. You can choose whether or not to use your Extra Attack feature for this frenzied attack. If there is more than one possible target, roll to randomly determine the target. You then regain control for the remainder of your turn.</text>
				<text>If you are under an effect that prevents you from concentrating (like the barbarian's Rage feature), you automatically fail this saving throw.</text>
			</feature>
		</autolevel>
		<autolevel level="4">
			<feature>
				<name>Ability Score Improvement</name>
				<text>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</text>
				<text>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</text>
			</feature>
		</autolevel>
		<autolevel level="5">
			<feature>
				<name>Extra Attack</name>
				<text>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</text>
			</feature>
		</autolevel>
		<autolevel level="6">
			<feature>
				<name>Blood Maledict Increase</name>
				<text>Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Blood Maledict feature twice before taking a short or long rest.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Blood Curses Increase</name>
				<text>At level 6, you now know 2 blood curses.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Brand of Castigation</name>
				<text>At 6th level, whenever you damage a creature with your Crimson Rite feature, you can choose to sear an arcane brand of hemocraft magic into it (requires no action). You always know the direction to the branded creature, and each time the branded creature deals damage to you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you, the creature takes psychic damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 damage).</text>
				<text>Your brand lasts until you dismiss it, or you apply a brand to another creature. Your brand counts as a spell for the purposes of dispel magic, and the spell level is equal to half of your blood hunter level (maximum of 9th level spell).</text>
				<text>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</text>
