      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Divine Domain: Order</name>
        <text>The Order Domain represents discipline, as well as devotion to the laws that govern a society, an institution, or a philosophy. Clerics of Order meditate on logic and justice as they serve their gods, examples of which appear in the Order Deities table.</text>
        <text>Clerics of Order believe that well-crafted laws establish legitimate hierarchies, and those selected by law to lead must be obeyed. Those who obey must do so to the best of their ability, and if those who lead fail to protect the law, they must be replaced. In this manner, law weaves a web of obligations that create order and security in a chaotic multiverse.</text>
        <text>You gain domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Order Domain Spells table. See the Divine Domain class feature in the Player's Handbook for how domain spells work.</text>

        <name>Order: Voice of Authority</name>
        <text>You can invoke the power of law to embolden an ally to attack. If you cast a spell with a spell slot of 1st level or higher and target an ally with the spell,
          that ally can use their reaction immediately after the spell to make one weapon attack against a creature of your choice that you can see.</text>
        <text>If the spell targets more than one ally, you choose the ally who can make the attack.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Divine Domain: Peace</name>
        <text>The balm of peace thrives at the heart of healthy communities, between friendly nations, and in the souls of the kindhearted. The gods of peace inspire people of all sorts to resolve conflict and to stand up against those forces that try to prevent peace from flourishing. See the Peace Deities table for a list of some of the gods associated with this domain.</text>
        <text>Clerics of the Peace Domain preside over the signing of treaties, and they are often asked to arbitrate in disputes. These clerics' blessings draw people together and help them shoulder one another's burdens, and the clerics' magic aids those who are driven to fight for the way of peace.</text>
        <text />

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Divine Domain: Twilight</name>
        <text>The twilit transition from light into darkness often brings calm and even joy, as the day's labors end and the hours of rest begin. The darkness can also bring terrors, but the gods of twilight guard against the horrors of the night.</text>
        <text>Clerics who serve these deities-examples of which appear on the Twilight Deities table-bring comfort to those who seek rest and protect them by venturing into the encroaching darkness to ensure that the dark is a comfort, not a terror.</text>
